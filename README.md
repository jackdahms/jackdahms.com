RUMMY TRACKA
=================

Track yer the scores of your rummy game.

Put each player's score for a turn under the "turn" column. These will be accumuluated in the "cum" column.

Options for adjusting the number of players, changing player nicknames, and resetting the game can be found under "Settings" in the bottom left.

Adjusting number of players will not affect scores (you can delete and re-add players without losing scores you've already entered).
